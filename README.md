# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

## Aim:
### The Objective of this project is to build an Model so that from Given clinical parameters about a patient to predict whether they have heart Disease or not.

## Libraries/ tools used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit learn
6. Jupyter notebook

## Description:
1. The Dataset is taken from the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
2. The EDA was done on the Dataset to get meaningfull insights of the patients.
3. Applying Classification techniques to get best model with best accuracy . 
4. Among three classifier algorithms(Logistic,Random forest, KNN). 
5. Logistic Regression fits the best model with an accuracy of 88.52% with improved ROC Curve, precision, recall, f1-score.
6. For example the below image shows the prediction of an patient who is male and has Heart Disease.
